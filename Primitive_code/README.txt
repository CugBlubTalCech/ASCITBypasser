This scrapes donut for all undergrad email addresses of students currently in the school. The users go back at least 20 years and the user numbers have random empty slots. The highest user number is no more than 14000 though and so the code iterates through that many user pages and gets the users email if they are currently in the school. It takes quite a while to run as the requests to donut are slow. Heavily improved code is being developed.
